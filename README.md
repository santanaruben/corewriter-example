     ```env
     MNEMONIC="your 12 words here"
     ```
3. **Getting funds from the Faucet**
   - Get some hyperEVM testnet USDC on the faucet https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/drip (you need 10 usdc on arbitrum mainnet).
   - You can route the assets between hyperEVM and hyperCORE in https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/portfolio
   - In order to get HYPE to deploy and make txs you need to trade that USDC in https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/trade and send HYPE to hyperEVM
4. **Configure your account to use HyperEVM Big Blocks**
   - Go to https://hyperevm-block-toggle.vercel.app/
   - Make sure you have funds on the hyperEVM testnet.
   - Set the top toggle to Testnet
   - Click the "BIG" button to enable HyperEVM Big Blocks
   - Accept the tx
5. **Deploy the contract**
   ```bash
   yarn deploy:hyperevmTestnet
   ```
6. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
7. **Open the main interface**
   - Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
